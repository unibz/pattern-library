&lt;p&gt;A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, &lt;q&gt;to write beside&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;written beside&lt;/q&gt;) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.&lt;/p&gt;
