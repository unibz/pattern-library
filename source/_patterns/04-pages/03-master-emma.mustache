        <h3>Course structure</h3>
        <p>
          The first study year is to be completed at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano and conveys a combination of natural science and technical skills and competences in nine compulsory modules. The second study year at the University of Innsbruck with two compulsory modules and several elective modules, gives students the possibility to focus on environmental and resource management, nature protection, landscape ecology and planning, agriculture and forestry as well as water and waste management. 
          Regardless of the chosen specialization, students learn to research scientifically, to approach target- and results-oriented and to work project-related in the course of their master’s thesis.
