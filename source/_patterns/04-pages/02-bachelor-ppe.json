    "excerpt": {"medium": "My name is Elena, I am 21 years old and I come from Milan. I'm studying Economics and Social Sciences, commonly known as PPE. The reason I chose unibz? Because I can switch from one language to the other and create 'Genglitalian' neologisms (a mix of German, English and Italian) and the others do understand me! After my Abitur at the Deutsche Schule Mailand, I wanted to keep up my multilingualism. I did not want to study languages; I wanted to study in more languages. With PPE it was love at first sight: Philosophie, Politica and Economics – three study areas that intertwine in three languages. I can talk 'gemischt', communicating in the most spontaneous way 'quello che mi passa per la testa'. And that's what I like about unibz! "}
